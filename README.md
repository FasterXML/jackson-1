# Jackson 1.x

This repository is a copy of Jackson 1.9 branch, the only open maintenance branch for Jackson 1.x.

For the actively development version of Jackson, check out [Jackson 2.x](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) repository instead.

## Licensing

Jackson 1.x can be used for any purpose, but to (re)distribute it,  distributors
(such as libraries and frameworks that use Jackson) will need to
choose which License they want to apply to distribution, and to use appropriate
jars that enclose license documentation.
No work needed beyond choosing the appropriate jar(s).

Currently two Open Source licenses are available for use:

* Apache License 2.0 (AL 2.0)
* Lesser/Library General Public License (LGPL 2.1)

## Status

Jackson 1.x is not being actively developed, but it is still possible that bug fixes are included
and new patch versions released.
